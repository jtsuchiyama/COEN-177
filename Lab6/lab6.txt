Title: Lab 6 - Observations
Description: This text file documents all of my observations in COEN 177L Lab 6.

1. 
First we need to setup and boot VMWare by running the following commands.
- 'setup vmware'
- 'minix-get-image'
- 'vmware &'

Then, we need to open up the VMWare by clicking on 'Minix3' and clicking the 'Power on' button

As the VMWare is launching, it will log you in with the username 'user' automatically. You may setup a password if you choose using the 'passwd' command.

Next, we need to setup an FTP connection so that we can transfer files between the virtual machine and the host machine. In your virtual machine, run
- 'tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &'
- 'iconfig'

Using the address that appears as a result of the 'ifconfig' command, in your host machine run
- ftp <address>

Next, we will be using the FTP connection that was just setup to transfer the main.c file to our host machine so that we can edit it. In your host machine, run
- 'cd /usr/src/kernel'
- 'get main.c'
- Navigate to the root/home directory where the main.c was transferred to and edit the file using a text editor or IDE'
- I added a printf message in void announce() to print an additional message with the copyright message
- Once the file is edited and saved, transfer the main.c back to the virtual machine using 'put main.c'

Finally, we need to remake the kernel and check that the changes worked. In your virtual machine, run
- 'cd /usr/src'
- 'make world'
- Once the make is complete, 'reboot'
- As the virtual machine is rebooting, you should be able to look for the changes that you made.
