Title: Lab3 - Observations
Description: This text file will document all of my observations for COEN 177 Lab 3.

6. Since the NTHREADS is defined as 10, the program creates 10 threads. In each for loop the values passed range from 0-9 inclusive. Additionally, while the thread return prints are always in ascending numerical order, the thread hello prints are in a random order. I am guessing that the bug occurs because the threads do not wait for the other threads before they end.
