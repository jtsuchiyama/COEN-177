Title: Lab 1 - Observations
Description: This text document holds the observations for Lab 1.

Step 1.
- First, the program echos the name of the shell file.
- It also echoes all of the files and their word counts in the directory.
- It then echoes the PATH environment variable, the path name of the home directory, the user name, the current directory path, and the process id of the current process.
- It then sends a welcome message with the $user and $numusers.
- At this point, it checks if the user is the user that is expected.
- Since my username is not the expected user, it exits the program, not allowing the user to calculate the area of the rectangle.
